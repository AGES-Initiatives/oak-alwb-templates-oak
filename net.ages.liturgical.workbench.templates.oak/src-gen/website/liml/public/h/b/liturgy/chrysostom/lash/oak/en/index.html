For you alone, Lord our God, are Ruler over all things in heaven and on earth, mounted on the throne of the Cherubim, Lord of the Seraphim and King of Israel, the only Holy One, resting in the holy place. Therefore I entreat you, who alone are good and ready to hear: Look upon me, your sinful and unprofitable servant, and purify my soul and heart from an evil conscience. By the power of your Holy Spirit enable me, clothed with the grace of the priesthood, to stand at this your Holy Table and celebrate the mystery of your holy and most pure Body and your precious Blood. For to you I come, bending my neck and praying: Do not turn away your face from me, nor reject me from among your children, but count me, your sinful and unworthy servant, worthy to offer these gifts to you. For you are the one who offers and is offered, who receives and is distributed, Christ our God, and to you we give glory, together with your Father, who is without beginning, and your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.
